## Core addons that aren't updated for Dragonflight yet:
[OmniCD](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/omnicd)
[Bigdebuffs](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bigdebuffs)

## General Todo
- [ ] Right now TMW Dragonriding is based on specific mount conditionals instead of something more general. Dont think I can make this more resilient until after DF launch if i dont want to spoil myself, also i have no idea if i’ll even need TMW icons for dragonriding abilities, or what the dragonriding UI looks like.
- [x] If other people don’t do it, update advanced execute plater mod for DF
- [x] Update resource bars for resource generation prediction for casts (AP from wrath, etc) - Too much CPU
- [x] PVP talent support
- [x] Think about where I can add ticks for various classes, or generally better the resource bars (like 80 rage rampage tick for warrior)
- [x] Regularly check WA talent conditionals on WA updates or talent tree updates which tend to break them
- [x] remember added custom functions to ZA and to copy them over on update
- [ ] Figure out the actually useful implementation of spellqueuewindow/latency for cast bar; for now I’ve just defaulted to latency

## Druid Todo
- [x] Protector of the pack, similar tracking to Scarlet Adaptation?

## Priest Todo:
- [ ] Made an assumption about Priest “coalescing shadows” 3 stack MB/MS being “glow worthy.” Have to see if this lines up with reality closer to launch rotation I guess?

## Warlock Todo:
- [x] Demonology Tier
- [x] May have to look over soul shard bar for DF
- [x] Aff Soul Tap Logic
- [x] May want to track stolen power (demo) but NYI??

## Evoker Todo:
- [x] Better essence bar - waiting for WA to update the triggers
- [x] Scarlet Adaptation tracking
- [x] 4PC (pres)
- [x] Iridisence Aura

## Rogue Todo:

- [x] Rogue combo point talent logic
- [x] Roll the Bones logic
- [x] Outlaw 4PC (Maybe)
- [ ] Procs/Warnings (Assassination dual poisons)


## Mage todo:
- [x] Make the freezing winds trackers prettier
