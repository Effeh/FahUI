## [Wowthing Collector](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/wowthing-collector)
https://wowthing.org/
https://github.com/ThingEngineering/wowthing-sync/releases/tag/v0.5.1

Pulls a ton of useful data out of your account and renders it to a webpage. Mount/transmog collecting, checking for progress on dailies/questlines, searching for items over your entire account, etc.

If you want to see an example, my url is here:

## [Azeroth Pilot Reloaded](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/azeroth-pilot-reloaded)
Continuation of AAP; levelling guide addon.

## [Adibags](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adibags)
Much more functional than the default Blizzard bags, but I’m trying to avoid using it this time due to them being ugly as sin.

## [Litemount](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/litemount)
Summons random mounts from your collection; very customizable. Useful even if you don’t use the random function to summon the correct mount for various situations (flying, ground, swimming, etc.)

## [Paragon Reputation](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/paragon-reputation)
Shows more info on the reputation screen, dunno if this will be useful in DF.

## [Tradeskillmaster](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/)
Essential for any serious goldmaking. Very complex, probably more addon than you need.

## [Oribos Exchange](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/oribos-exchange)
Performant alternative to TSM if all you want is item auction house values in tooltips.

## [World Quest Tracker](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/world-quest-tracker)
Definitely presents WQ information better than default, but often suffers performance problems and bugs.

## HearthRoulette(Optional folder in archive)
Isn’t being maintained so I just edit it myself. Generates a macro that randomly selects from one of your accumulated Hearthstone toys, already present on Opie wheel. You can delete your hearthstone to free up a bag slot if you use this (and actually have some hearthstone toys.)
